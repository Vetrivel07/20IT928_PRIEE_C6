Hey AllðŸ‘‹ As the team leader of our Fertilizer Prediction ProjectðŸŒ¿, I am excited to introduce our innovative solution that leverages advanced machine learning techniques to forecast optimal fertilizer recommendations for agricultural applications. Join us on this journey to empower farmers with precision agriculture through our cutting-edge predictive model.

#### Project Title: Fertilizer Recommendation System for Disease Prediction

ðŸ‘‰ I developed a Fertilizer Recommendation System, which I named <b> NutriGuide-AI </b>.

#### Project Domain: AI

## Problem Definition

* Productivity needs to be increased so that farmers can get more pay from the same piece of land without degrading soil.
* Indian farmers arenâ€™t able to choose the right crop based on their soil requirements depending upon factors like N, P, K, temperature, humidity, rainfall, pH.
* Due to inadequate and imbalanced fertilization, soil degradation is occurring, which leads to nutrient mining and the development of second-generation problems in nutrient management.
* According to a study by the Associated Chambers of Commerce and Industry of India, annual crop losses due to pests amount to Rs. 50,000 crore.

## Objective
* To implement precision agriculture (A modern farming technique that uses research data of soil characteristics, soil types, crop yield data collection and suggests the farmers the right crop based on their site specific parameters to reduce the wrong choice on a crop and increase in productivity). 
* To recommend fertilizer on the basis of N, P, K values and crop.
* To recognize the pest and recommend particular pesticide available in India as per ISO standards.
